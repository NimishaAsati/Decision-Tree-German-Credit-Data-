# Decision-Tree-German-Credit-Data-

Developed a credit scoring rule that can be used to help determine whether a new applicant presents a good or bad credit risk. 

Here, I attempted to obtain a decision tree based model to determine if new applicants present a good or bad credit risk.

Performed data explaoration, transformation and performed tuning of parameters to obtain good accuracy of the model.
